# Netlify Deployment Guide

## Current Configuration

Your project is now properly configured for Netlify deployment with the following settings:

### netlify.toml
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### Key Changes Made

1. **Fixed Port Configuration**: Changed Vite dev server port from 8080 to 5173 (standard)
2. **Added Build Optimizations**: Configured proper chunk splitting and build output
3. **Added SPA Redirects**: Ensured all routes work properly with React Router
4. **Specified Node Version**: Set Node.js 18 for consistent builds

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Netlify deployment configuration"
   git push
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify**:
   - Connect your repository to Netlify
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
   - Node version: 18

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Build Logs**: Look for any build errors in Netlify's build logs
2. **Verify Dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
3. **Test Locally**: Run `npm run build` locally to verify it works
4. **Check Node Version**: Ensure Netlify uses Node.js 18

## Build Output

Your build generates:
- `dist/index.html` - Main HTML file
- `dist/assets/` - Optimized CSS and JS bundles
- `dist/admin/` - Netlify CMS files (if using)

The build process takes about 3-4 minutes and creates optimized bundles for production.
